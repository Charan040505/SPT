# User Registration Flow Documentation

## System Overview

The Student Performance Tracker has been updated to use a simplified direct registration system without email verification. This document outlines the updated registration flow, API endpoints, and implementation details.

## Architecture

### Components
- Frontend: Next.js React components
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Authentication: Direct login after registration
- Storage: User data management

## Flow Diagram
```
User Registration → Create User Account → Redirect to Login → User Logs In → Access System
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. User Signup (`/api/auth/signup`)
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Creates a new user account
- **Request Body**: 
  ```json
  { 
    "name": string,
    "email": string,
    "password": string,
    "role": "student" | "admin" | "parent"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": string,
    "user": UserObject,
    "status": "success" | "error"
  }
  ```

### 2. User Login (`/api/auth/login`)
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Authenticates user and provides access
- **Request Body**: 
  ```json
  { 
    "email": string,
    "password": string,
    "role": "student" | "admin" | "parent"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": string,
    "user": UserObject,
    "status": "success" | "error"
  }
  ```

## Security Measures

### Password Security
- Passwords should be properly hashed in a production environment
- Implement password complexity requirements
- Add rate limiting for login attempts

### Data Protection
- Secure user data storage
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Implementation Details

### User Registration Component
- Located at `/src/app/register/page.tsx`
- Collects user information
- Submits to signup API endpoint
- Redirects to login page on success

### Login Component
- Located at `/src/app/login/page.tsx`
- Authenticates user credentials
- Provides access to the system on successful login

### User Model
- User data structure includes:
  - name
  - email
  - role
  - password (hashed)
  - avatarUrl
  - Additional role-specific fields

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation (for future authentication enhancements)
- Additional configuration variables as needed

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. User registration with valid data
2. User registration with existing email
3. User login with valid credentials
4. User login with invalid credentials

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logging
- Log registration attempts
- Track login success/failure rates
- Monitor for suspicious activities

### Performance
- Monitor API response times
- Track user registration completion rates

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication
- Social login integration
- Password reset functionality
- Account recovery options

## Support

### Common Issues
- Registration failures
- Login problems
- Account access issues

### Troubleshooting
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify user data in the database
- Ensure proper environment configuration
